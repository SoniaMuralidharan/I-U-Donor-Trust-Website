I take this opportunity to share with you an initiative, which is considered to be a touch-stone in the lives of many. It is about that human instinct which makes us to realize that all of us have the potency to make our life better by touching one another’s life.The thought may not be new but I am making an attempt to perceive the same in an unique manner. It is through “DONATION OF ORGAN” to the needy. Many of us have the secret desire to live even after our life. Let us take this opportunity to materialize this desire.
<br><br>
This idea knocked me when I found a school boy who helped a blind man to cross the road when others were mere spectators.
<br><br>
With this thought, I have incepted a Trust named as “I & U donor Trust”. The foundation was laid on August 17, 2013 and a FaceBook page in the name of “I & U Donor trust” was also created. This platform is used to reach people and guide them with the awareness of organ donation. By virtue of this Trust I have been able to reach out as many as " 376 " people who have committed to donate their organ/s.As per statistics a single organ donor is capable of saving the lives of 8 individuals. 
<br><br>
The Aim of this Trust is to approach the Chief Minister of TamilNadu who has implemented several lives changing facet to add a pledge in this regard in text books issued to the schools,which I believe shall bring a drastic change in the perception of each and every child who shall create a better future with 
their human touch. 
<br><br>
This being a social cause can’t be done in isolation. So, friends I appeal you to join hands for a cause of betterment…for a brighter world nevertheless for a beautiful world for all. 
<br><br>
