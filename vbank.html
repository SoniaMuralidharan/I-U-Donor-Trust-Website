					<h3><strong><u>WOMEN PROTECTION</u></strong></h3>

					<h3><strong><u>FEMALE FOETICIDE</u></strong></h3>
					<br>
					<img src="images/female-infanticide.png" height="500px" width="500px">
					<font color="black" size="2">
					<p>This is the act of aborting female foetuses. This problem is linked to the dowry system whereby women are expected to pay dowry to the men in spite of the fact that it was prohibited in the year 1961. Unlike in western cultures, Indians have a strong inclination for sons over daughters. Pregnancies are planned using differential contraception. Foetal foeticide has led to social discrimination against women and they are treated as second-rate citizens. 80% of the districts in India have recorded a high male sex ratio with the state of Punjab recording the highest ratio. An estimated ten million female foetuses have been aborted illegitimately in India. The social impact of these abortions is an increase in human trafficking. Trafficking is rampant in areas where the numbers of women are low due to female foeticide. To curb this problem, the Indian government should take strict actions against those who practice it.

					<h3><strong><u>EVE TEASING</u></strong></h3>
					<br>
					<img src="images/eveteasing.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					<font color="black" size="2">
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Eve teasing is a euphemism for sexual harassment of females by males in public areas. This aggression differs in severity from mild brushing and taunts to the more serious groping in public areas. Some human rights organizations have been at the forefront lobbying against the use of this term. They argue that the term makes a serious infringement on women rights to appear innocuous. The challenge that faces victims of eve teasing is how to prove that a total stranger has sexually harassed them. It is becoming increasingly difficult to prove such crimes because offenders have found clever ways of harassing women. There are many tourist guide books that warn foreign women to avoid attracting attention from perpetrators of these crimes by dressing conservatively. However, both tourists and Indian women are harassed regardless of what they are wearing. The number of women’s organizations working for women rights in India has gone up. Victims of this crime can seek recourse in court. Perpetrators of these crimes are punished by imprisonment, fines or both.

					<h3><strong><u>BRIDE BURNING</u></strong></h3>
					<br>
					<img src="images/bride.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					<font color="black" size="2">
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>This is a type of domestic violence whereby a bride is killed by her husband or husband’s family because of dowry dissatisfaction issues. Kerosene is the fuel of choice for most perpetrators. This crime has been a problem since the year 1993. Perpetrators of this crime are punished accordingly by either giving them a death sentence or a life sentence. 2,500 deaths per year in India are attributed to bride burning. There have been several attempts by the government to combat this crime. They include:
<br><br>
1961 – The government passed a dowry prohibition act to cease dowry murders. The act was amended in the early 1980′s to correct some inherent flaws and loopholes. After the amendment, bride burning within the first 7 years of marriage became a crime. Unfortunately, the definition of dowry is still vague and this only changed the way dowry is asked for and delivered. Another shortcoming of this act is the inclusion of a seven year clause which makes it easy for perpetrators because they wait until the period lapses.
<br><br>
1983 - The anti cruelty statute forbids cruelty towards wives and subjects the perpetrators of such crimes to imprisonment and/or fines. However, this law is somewhat ambiguous and this leads to insufficient enforcement of bride burning murders.
<br><br>
This problem can be alleviated by allowing women to have properties. This way, women would not need to marry for economic, legal or social reasons. As a result, the dowry practice would be disregarded.

					<h3><strong><u>DOWRY</u></strong></h3>
					<br>
					<img src="images/dowry.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					<font color="black" size="2"><br><br>
					In India, the dowry prohibition act which was enacted in 1961 outlaws the giving or receiving of dowry. However, giving and receiving of dowry is still practiced to date. Women are faced with the pressure of giving dowry to the bridegroom’s family. This is a violation of the women rights in India because it gives them financial burdens. The dowry is considered as a bribe to the man so that he can agree to keep the woman, especially if she is too old to be unmarried. Dowry can be anything from cash to gifts. The gifts include:<br><br>
<li> Jewellery<br>
<li> Furniture<br>
<li> Motor Vehicle<br>
<li> Home<br>
<li> Cash<br>
<br>
Dowry is not only given before the wedding but the husband’s family expects to be given gifts and/or cash even after the wedding. This places a heavy financial strain on the bride’s family. If the husband and his family are dissatisfied with the dowry, they can mistreat the wife. The dowry system in India is the root of many problems against women such as bride burning and female foeticide. If strict measures are put in place to combat the dowry system, a lot of problems that face women can be eliminated.

					<h3><strong><u>RAPE</u></strong></h3>
					<br>
					<img src="images/rape.jpg">
					<font color="black" size="2">
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>This is among the most common crimes against women in India. Marital rape was made illegal in 1983 but it is still rampant. Rape is a heinous crime against humanity and it seriously undermines women rights. Rape in India is a crime that occurs every 54 minutes and it violates a woman and her privacy. The rape cases in India are constantly making headlines because of the brutality with which they are executed. In December 2012, a 23 year-old girl was gang raped in a public bus. The rapists penetrated her with a metallic rod and this destroyed her intestines which had to be removed through surgery.
<br><br>
There have been scores of other rape incidents in India. In most of these rape cases, the law fails the victim because of vague interpretations and this is absolute disrespect of women rights in India. Delays and humiliating cross examination of victims makes them afraid to come forward. As a result, many cases of rape go unreported. To curb rape cases, awareness campaigns need to be done. Men should also learn the importance of respecting women rights. Women need to be taught self defense mechanisms so that they can protect themselves.

					<h3><strong><u>Knowing the times that we are in, we give you, yet again, an overview of some important legal rights for women that every one must be aware of.</u></strong></h3>
					<br>
					<font color="black" size="2">
					<br>
					<p><b>1. Free legal aid<br><br></b>
Exercise your right to free legal aid. Often, women go to the police station unaccompanied by a lawyer to get their statement recorded, and they stand the risk of being misquoted or their statement being tampered with. The police may also treat the entire episode lightly and not lodge an FIR. So, it is necessary to have a lawyer with you while you lodge the FIR. “According to a Delhi High Court ruling, whenever a rape is reported, the SHO has to bring this to the notice of the Delhi Legal Services Authority. The legal body then arranges for a lawyer for the victim,” says Saumya Bhaumik, women rights lawyer.
<br><br>
<b>2. Right to privacy while recording statement<br><br></b>
Under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a woman who has been raped can record her statement before the district magistrate when the case is under trial, and no one else needs to be present. Alternatively, she can record the statement with only one police officer and woman constable in a convenient place that is not crowded and does not provide any possibility of the statement being overheard by a fourth person. The cops have to, by law, upkeep the woman's right to privacy. It's important for the person to feel comfortable and not be under any kind of stress while narrating the incident.
<br><br>
<b>3. Time doesn't matter<br><br></b>
The police cannot refuse to register an FIR even if a considerable period of time has elapsed since the incident of rape or molestation took place. If the police tells you that they can't lodge your FIR since you didn't report it earlier, do not concede. "Rape is a horrifying incident for any woman, so it's natural for her to go into shock and not want to report it immediately. She may also fear for her safety and the reputation and dignity of her family. For this reason, the Supreme Court has ruled that the police must register an FIR even if there has been a gap between the report and the occurrence of the incident," says Tariq Abeed, advocate, Supreme Court.
<br><br>
<b>4. Email to the rescue<br><br></b>
According to the guidelines issued by the Delhi Police, a woman has the privilege of lodging a complaint via email or registered post. If, for some reason, a woman can't go to the police station, she can send a written complaint through an email or registered post addressed to a senior police officer of the level of Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner of Police. The officer then directs the SHO of the police station, of the area where the incident occurred, to conduct proper verification of the complainant and lodge an FIR. The police can then come over to the residence of the victim to take her statement.
<br><br>
<b>5. Cops can't say no<br><br></b>
Arape victim can register her police complaint from any police station under the Zero FIR ruling by Supreme Court. "Sometimes, the police station under which the incident occurs refuses to register the victim's complaint in order to keep clear of responsibility, and tries sending the victim to another police station. In such cases, she has the right to lodge an FIR at any police station in the city under the Zero FIR ruling. The senior officer will then direct the SHO of the concerned police station to lodge the FIR," says Abeed. This is a Supreme Court ruling that not many women are aware of, so don't let the SHO of a police station send you away saying it "doesn't come under his area".
<br><br>
<b>6. No arrests after sunset<br><br></b>
According to a Supreme Court ruling, a woman cannot be arrested after sunset and before sunrise. There are many cases of women being harassed by the police at wee hours, but all this can be avoided if you exercise the right of being present in the police station only during daytime. "Even if there is a woman constable accompanying the officers, the police can't arrest a woman at night. In case the woman has committed a serious crime, the police has to get it in writing from the magistrate explaining why the arrest is necessary during the night," says Bhaumik.
<br><br>
<b>7. You can't be called to the police station<br><br></b>
Women cannot be called to the police station for interrogation under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This law provides Indian women the right of not being physically present at the police station for interrogation. "The police can interrogate a woman at her residence in the presence of a woman constable and family members or friends," says Abeed. So, the next time you're called to the police station for queries or interrogation when you have faced any kind of harassment, quote this guideline of the Supreme Court to exercise your right and remind the cops about it.
<br><br>
<b>8. Protect your identity<br><br></b>
Under no circumstances can the identity of a rape victim be revealed. Neither the police nor media can make known the name of the victim in public. Section 228-A of the Indian Penal Code makes the disclosure of a victim's identity a punishable offense. Printing or publishing the name or any matter which may make known the identity of a woman against whom an offense has been committed is punishable. This is done to prevent social victimisation or ostracism of the victim of a sexual offense. Even while a judgment is in progress at the high court or a lower court, the name of the victim is not indicated, she is only described as 'victim' in the judgment.
<br><br>
<b>9. The doctor can't decide<br><br></b>
Acase of rape can't be dismissed even if the doctor says rape had not taken place. A victim of rape needs to be medically examined as per Section 164 A of the Criminal Procedure Code, and only the report can act as proof. "A woman has the right to have a copy of the medical report from the doctor. Rape is crime and not a medical condition. It is a legal term and not a diagnosis to be made by the medical officer treating the victim. The only statement that can be made by the medical officer is that there is evidence of recent sexual activity. Whether the rape has occurred or not is a legal conclusion and the doctor can't decide on this," explains Bhaumik.
<br><br>
<b>10. Employers must protect<br><br></b>
It is the duty of every employer to create a Sexual Harassment Complaints Committee within the organisation for redressal of such complaints. According to a guideline issued by the Supreme Court, it is mandatory for all firms, public and private, to set up these committees to resolve matters of sexual harassment. It is also necessary that the committee be headed by a woman and comprise 50% women as members. Also, one of the members should be from a women's welfare group.<br><br>
